This page is designed to help businesses, especially BBB Accredited Businesses, create an online privacy policy for use
on the Internet. When a business is conducting e-commerce or collecting sensitive data online, the BBB Code of Business
Practices (BBB Accreditation Standards) requires that BBB Accredited Businesses have some sort of privacy policy on
their website. To meet BBB accreditation standards, privacy policies must be based on the following five elements:

• Policy (what personal information is being collected on the site)

• Choice (what options the customer has about how/whether her data is collected and used)

• Access (how a customer can see what data has been collected and change/correct it if necessary)

• Security (state how any data that is collected is stored/protected)

• Redress (what customer can do if privacy policy is not met)

• Updates (how policy changes will be communicated)

This webpage will attempt to give some resources to use in developing your privacy policy. Whatever final policy you
develop is up to you, and will be your responsibility to maintain. The Better Business Bureau does not recommend any one
set of privacy practices, nor any single privacy policy.

Your business bears full responsibility for the policy that you post. Once a privacy policy is posted online, it is
crucial that a business adheres to it. An online service provider that doesn’t follow its privacy policy may violate
state and federal consumer protection laws, the Texas Business and Commerce Code Sec. 501.052 and Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act.

Below is a sample privacy policy that you may want to use as a guide for your privacy policy. Note that there is a place
for your business name or URL in the first paragraph, and a place for your phone number and email address in the last
paragraph. Please make sure to personalize these. DO NOT simply cut-and-paste this policy as is.

Should you have questions about privacy policies and Standard 7 of the BBB Code of Business Practices, feel free to
contact our Business Relations Department at businessrelations@dallas.bbb.org.
